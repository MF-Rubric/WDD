<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
There are a range of supports available for students with disabilities in Waterford Institute of Technology
(WIT). To access disability supports evidence of disability is required. Evidence of disability is assessed by
professionals in our institution who have expertise and an in-depth knowledge of disability and reasonable
accommodations.	
</p>
<h2>How to Apply for Supports</h2>	
<p>
New, incoming first year students, once you have accepted your offer in WIT, please email the Disability
Office at disabilityoffice@wit.ie and arrange an appointment to carry out an individual needs assessment. 	
</p>
<p>
Students that have received their offer through the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) please email
the disability office at disabilityoffice@wit.ie and arrange an appointment to carry out an individual needs
assessment.	
</p>
<p>
Continuing students, please email the Disability Office at disabilityoffice@wit.ie and arrange an
appointment to carry out an individual needs assessment.	
</p>
<p>
Please note that each year, a large volume of students register with the Disability Office, therefore, it is very
important that you contact the Disability Office and arrange a needs assessment appointment as soon as
possible in order to have your supports in place for academic learning, classroom participation and
examination support. In order to apply for supports from the Disability Office you will need to provide
